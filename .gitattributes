# --- Default Handling ---
# Auto-detect text files and enforce LF (Unix-style) line endings for consistency.
# This is critical for preventing issues when files are edited on Windows (CRLF)
# but used in Linux-based environments like Docker containers (which expect LF).
* text=auto eol=lf

# --- Source Code ---
# Explicitly define Python files as text with LF line endings.
*.py text eol=lf

# --- Configuration Files ---
# Ensure consistent line endings for all configuration files.
*.toml text eol=lf
*.ini text eol=lf
*.cfg text eol=lf
*.yaml text eol=lf
*.yml text eol=lf
.editorconfig text eol=lf
.env.example text eol=lf

# --- Documentation ---
# Enforce LF for Markdown files to ensure consistent rendering.
*.md text eol=lf

# --- Build, CI/CD & Git ---
# Ensure build scripts and ignore files have consistent LF endings.
Makefile text eol=lf
Dockerfile text eol=lf
.dockerignore text eol=lf
.gitignore text eol=lf
.gitattributes text eol=lf

# --- Binary Files ---
# Mark common binary file types to prevent Git from attempting to normalize
# their line endings, which could corrupt the files.
*.png binary
*.jpg binary
*.jpeg binary
*.gif binary
*.ico binary
